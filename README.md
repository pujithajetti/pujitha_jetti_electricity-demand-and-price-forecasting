Electricity Demand and Price Forecasting

Project Overview

This project employs machine learning techniques to forecast electricity demand and prices. I compare the performance of two advanced predictive models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest.

Research Objectives

1. Develop accurate predictive models for electricity demand and pricing
2. Compare the performance of LSTM and Random Forest algorithms
3. Investigate the potential of machine learning techniques in energy forecasting

Methodology

1. Data Collection: Electricity demand and price data from Kaggle
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning,scaling,encoding, normalization, and feature engineering
3. Model Development: LSTM and Random Forest models
4. Model Evaluation: Performance comparison using accuracy metrics

Results

1. LSTM Model: Achieved 96.74% accuracy
2. Random Forest Model: Achieved 94.40% accuracy

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques in electricity demand and price forecasting. The high accuracy of both models, particularly the LSTM approach, suggests that these algorithms can provide reliable predictions for energy management and economic planning.
